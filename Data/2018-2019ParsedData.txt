2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Dr. T is very knowledgeable on the subject. I enjoyed the lectures where she would reference her real world experience fat Microsoft and correlate that with the material that we were learning.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	The instructor had a great way of encouraging students to learn the material by having different groups deliver a lecture regarding a section of the course.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Very easy going, though the lecture material is not that great the homework makes you learn the material.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Group presentations helped to learn the material better
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	She is good at reading powerpoints, I guess.

2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	She was always very well prepared for class. Despite the long length of this particular section of the class she structured the class/lectures in such a way as to keep my interest. She also did a great job answering questions and had a sense of humor which made the long lectures bearable.

2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I would've personally enjoyed more programming assignments.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Professor Tzacheva needs to get the class more involved in the material that she is covering. She tends to speak in a monotone voice and writes the material on the white board nearly word for word from the book. I think she is a good teacher but just needs to work on her presentation skills, make class more interactive and interesting, and ask more questions of the students.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	A little more enthusiasm when presenting to the class.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	material itself is very dry, perhaps more real life examples would make it more interesting and relevant
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Don't talk at us for 2 and a half hours. The class would do well to integrate clicker questions and discussion
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Much of the material is outdated; lectures, homework, and test are straight from a text with outdated material; and there is no material offered to compliment the book or clarify concepts. These issue desperately need to be fixed.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Text was dry and may need to be updated.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I found that this class was rather boring. I was not enthusiastic about the manner in which the material was being presented. I think an effective way to improve the atmosphere in the class would be to restructure how the material is presented in the class by implementing a more hand on class period. Perhaps live demonstrations of have the operating systems work on the projector.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The entire structure of tests should be seriously changed! The tests do not test how well you know the material, they simply test how well you can find an exact string of text from the book. If you look at the class statistics, everyone should be doing very well (A or B), however no one really knows the material. Students have brought up the odd format of the tests, but the instructor seems unwilling to make more appropriate tests. While I am glad I will be getting an A in this class, I am sad that I have hardly learned a thing. There should be more programming assignments instead of incredibly easy book questions. Over all I was not satisfied with what I got out of this class (despite getting an A).
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The textbook was painful to read. It made topics that should be interesting seem boring
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	At least half of the lectures were given by students in groups. She said this was to promote group work and oral presentation skills which I can appreciate, but this class isn't the place to do that in my opinion. I would have liked to learn about how operating systems work, but instead I listened to lectures given by students who didn't know any more than I did. In a class with as much technical material as this one, I feel like students shouldn't be the ones in front of the class.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Please change the test structure to actually test the student's knowledge, and assign more programming projects.
2013	Fall 2013	Operating Syst and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Class always starts 15-20 minutes after the assigned time period. I would rather start on time and leave early . I was very disappointed with my presentation grade. I felt that it was more of a participation grade than based on individual effort. My group put hours of more work into our presentation and received the same grade as some groups (Disks) that simply printed off the chapter and read from the book , verbatim. If I had known it was a participation grade I would have skipped all of the creative things we did to make it enjoyable and easy to understand. It wasn't fair because clearly some groups put forth more of an effort .:(

2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	the provided powerpoints were useless, most questions to homeworks could be found by searching on the internet, and testing was a nightmare. All test questions had to be the word for word answer found in the boo. The only way to get through tests with a grade greater than an F was to find a format of the book that supported searching, then search key words until you find the exact place in the text that the question came from, and even then there was no garente that you would get it right due to ambiguious wording

2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	This is not an online course. It the notes from an in-class course posted on Moodle. I feel like this university would be put under investigation for fraud if the details of how this course was administrated were made public. If the university wants this to be an online course, it should go through the trouble of designing an online curriculum and not simply making the exams "open book / open note" through Moodle.

2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The tests are incredibly thourough and not so much about the learned information but more so about finding exact scentences in the book and comparing them to statements on the test to check for validity.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Spread out the assignments or add new ones so that when the end of semester comes their is not a 3 week period in which students don't touch any material related to the course
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Since this class of offered 100% online, I would suggest taking out the group project and instead having an individual project. It was very difficult to get the group to meet, let alone do the work. Most of the work was done by the few people who wanted to get a good grade.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Do something other than post readings in Moodle. My only way to learn is by reading the most dry textbook ever written.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Don't assign group projects for an online only class; the reason I take classes online is because if I have the choice I prefer doing work on my own and because I enjoy the freedom of not being required to meet at an established place and time, and group projects nullify both of those things. Come up with some original content for the course. Our reading was from the text, the slides were from the publisher, the supplemental videos were posted by other people on YouTube, and the homework questions and exams were pulled straight from the text. This course provided me with absolutely no advantage over simply buying the textbook and browsing YouTube on my own. If you must have a group project, make it a semester-long thing that builds on itself as new topics are covered; don't make it focus on solving one problem from one sub-section of one chapter from the text.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The teacher does not communicate with us at all. Have more communication with us.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The test online were very difficult because questions were the same with some questions requiring just more detail
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Professor lacks communication skills. Takes a long time to reply to emails and emails are not very clear.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Make the groups smaller. Organizing 7 people with different schedules is extremely hard. There will inevitably be people that have nothing to do in the group project.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I would suggest letting students pick their partners for the group project.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Please remove the programming group project for this class. I nor do I believe that any of the other students enrolled in this class were expecting an online course to have a group project component. Many people choose to enroll in an online course because of scheduling conflicts due to work, other classes and home life. It was a huge pain to have to corral the the students to produce work for our group project in time and especially so since the only form of communication was through email, if I saw the other students every other day in class I believe that the results would have differed. I also believe that the project's programming aspect was quite a challenge for most students and we were not adequately prepared for it. None of the programming classes that I have taken a UNCC ever taught the class how to program a GUI. I would not mind doing a project that required writing one if I had learned how to do it beforehand either in another programming class or if this class had taught us before the project was even assigned.

2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	I was really looking forward to taking this course; when I learn about something, I'm not satisfied unless I can understand it at its most fundamental level. Therefore, I was greatly looking forward to getting an introduction to the most basic level of software in any computing system. However, the laziness of the instructor (exhibited primarily by her over-reliance on the sometimes heady and complicated text, as well as her complete lack of original learning material) and the inefficient and sloppy style of "instruction" left me disappointed and almost as ignorant of operating systems fundamentals as I was before I took the course.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	I learned nothing in this course. When all that is required for the course is 1 group project and a handful of 2-question assignments, there is little motivation to learn material you care nothing about. I took each test knowing absolutely nothing about the material, yet came out with As on both because you allow three hours on a 20 question online exam. I would say this course was a waste of my time, but I didn't actually have to spend any time on it. It was a big waste of my money though.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The book which was chosen for this course is an amazing learning tool. There is a lot of very useful and necessary information covered in the textbook. This hardly applies to all classes. I hope that the instructor will continue using this book in the future.
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	I wish I had taken this in class rather than online. While the information is there I feel I will not get as much out of this class compared to if I took in in class
2014	Fall 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	This should absolutely not be an online course, and the Networking section should be its own course with more time dedicated to Operating Systems in this course. I feel like I barely learned anything from this course despite earning an A, and I will need to take a proper OS course at some point to compensate.

2014	Fall 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	I was really looking forward to taking this course; these days, computer networks are almost synonymous with computers themselves, and with the rise of the cloud and SaaS, one cannot be a software engineer or developer without having a solid understanding of how networks work. However, the laziness of the instructor (exhibited primarily by her over-reliance on the sometimes heady and complicated text, as well as her complete lack of original learning material) and the inefficient and sloppy style of "instruction" left me disappointed and almost as ignorant of networking as I was before I took the course.

2014	Fall 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The group project for this class, (which I made an A on) seemed to have little relevance to the course itself. I was required to program a simulation of packet routing, complete with a GUI...which we have only only touched on in the barest form in my programming classes at UNCC. By barest form I mean nothing more than user input and Dialog boxes displaying simple messages to the user. So needless to say this was quite difficult.

All tests questions came nearly word for word from the text book and as the book can be found online its a simple ctrl + f and easily get 100's on every test and assignment.
2015	Fall 2015	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	There was a group project that in my opinion should have been an individual assignment. The reason is because from talking to other groups, I have gathered that what ended up happening was one person would do the entire project to avoid having the communication overhead.

2015	Fall 2015	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Generally, there were one or two ambiguous questions on each test whose answer depended on a certain interpretation of the question. In short, make sure the test questions are clear and don't require assumptions.

2015	Fall 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Would generally be helpful if professor could be bothered to show up to class on time, not 10+ minutes late every class, could actually answer questions about course material, and didn't have students teaching 50% of the course.

2015	Fall 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The instructor is absolutely impossible to follow. The lectures are essentially reading shorthand notes from a powerpoint, much more confusing than necessary, in an accent very hard to understand (for a person who has lived abroad), and feels completely pointless compared to the work. The homework, group assignments, and even tests seem completely different from the actual course content. It is fair to give open-note exams, but the course itself seems superfluous and uninteresting. I forget I am in this class due to the inconsistent nature of group work, discussion points.
2015	Fall 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	very dull and boring; create activities with more interaction and engagement with others
2015	Fall 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	When writing on the board make sure the markers write, half the time I could not read what was written. Also people in the front row cannot see what is being written on the opposite side of the screen from where they are sitting.
2015	Fall 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	This course should have been miles more difficult and would have been much more helpful if it was. I could be asked any information about this course and i wouldn't be able to answer them correctly.

2015	Fall 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Even though I had a fairly poor team for my group project, it helped me learn more about the topics at hand. I think my professor did a pretty decent job with the course material.
2015	Fall 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	teacher was difficult to understand
2015	Fall 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	I would like to preface this by asking you to please excuse any snappiness or rashness in my writing. I am very upset at how this professor has performed. This professor is the laziest professor I have ever come across. Lectures are just reading off of notes and writing a bunch of words on the board, which usually have no relevance to any assignments or the tests. Assignments consist of 2 questions semi-randomly plucked from the textbook. Video assignments are just YouTube videos (that are not hers) with questions taken straight from the video. Time management for her lectures is awful, as she initially has assignments due at the end of class but either a) leaves about 10 minutes to turn them in or b) extends the deadline to midnight because she left no time at all. Group work and presentations are a complete waste of time. Tests are absolutely horrible and lazily thrown together (One question's correct answer was based on the difference between "exits" and "exists"). I would like to mention that I think the flipped class style of the course is NOT to blame. I am taking an Accounting class which is a flipped class and it is actually quite good. But in that case the professor actually puts EFFORT into the course (Example: He makes all of the videos we watch outside of class himself rather than plucking videos from YouTube).

2016	Fall 2016	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I would have liked to receive feedback as to my groups grade on our presentation. While we received the grade sheet, I was unable to see where points were taken off or why they were taken off. Additionally, I wish she would have provided feedback on the project components, which is required to be turned in three days before the presentation, so they could be adjusted for the presentation if needed. Finally, I would post the solution to the homework assignments and exams online. I am aware that we went over them in class, however, I would have liked to go over them and ensure I was correct on my own. Going off of this, I wish she would have allowed us a week to do the homework instead of a day. This is especially true when the videos were long and dry or they were three or more assignments due in a day.

2016	Fall 2016	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Try to engage students more during the lecture part. You do that by testing student's understanding of the presented content frequently. Either ask questions to the plenum, collect short written answers, or have a multiple choice question on the screen and let students raise their hands for the answer they think is correct. Also, you could distribute slides prior to class. These slides are identical to the ones you present with the exception that they contain blanks that students are supposed to fill. These and more methods were taught to me in a teaching seminar offered by the Center for Teaching and Learning. I am sure they can help you improve if you want to.

2017	Fall 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	She could be more engaging during the lectures, and talk to the class rather than reading the notes on the Powerpoint slides from her paper. It appears that she doesn't know that material that well because she has to read the notes she has written for each slide. It also leads to a lot of pauses and downtime during the lecture as she is reviewing her notes for the next slide before presenting it. Also, the exercises aren't really valuable because we are just copying and pasting code. I have learned some about how to navigate various tools, but not how to actually use those tools to apply data mining algorithms. There should be less time spent on revisiting theory behind mining algorithms, which is covered in other required courses, and more time on the actual implementation and coding for Hadoop.
2017	Fall 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The course has so much to learn but we wasted lots of class in learning basic analytics topics which we have already learnt in other courses. Could have been more hands on. Though there were weekly assignments, all the instructions were given before it was more like a robotic implementation of instructions than learning. Take back from this course was very less. And there is no proper project to implement whatever we have learnt.

She doesn't involve students to interact and learn. Her lectures are more like a monolog and she doesn't talk to students. Also, everything is very slow in the class. Class doesn't start on-time. There were always, at least, 10 to 15 minutes delay in starting time of the class, even after each break, that there should be just 15 minutes of break. Sometimes breaks were more than 30 minutes.

2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The problem with doing the work and you will get an A is in how this teaches students nothing about the actual subject material. There are a lot of different ways this course can be taught and this instructor ensures it is taught in a very BORING way. She doesn't seem excited about this course, the students learning about the subject material, or anything really. It is very sad. The book is terrible. Get rid of it. It is a waste of money and effort to read. Most of the information in the book is dated. The questions in the book rarely connect with the actual chapter material anyway. The book is the basis for tests. For a student to do well in this course, you don't need to understand the actual material. To do well in this course all you really need to be able to do is read the book. This is useless. Each question on the test is set up to trick you without testing your knowledge, only your reading comprehension skills. The tests don't test you, they test you against the book. The homework questions for the material are a waste of time and aren't really reflected in the tests. This wastes everyone's time. The lecture is boring and has no value as she essentially "vomits" information on the board "guided" by a powerpoint. For students its just fact memory and then regurgitation without context or true understanding.
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Text somewhat antiquated; also, information is read and presented, but opportunity to interact with and engage the material is somewhat lacking
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	boring...
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	enthusiasm when presenting material.
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The group project due dates are staggered, maybe make them all due relatively earlier in the semester so some groups don't get a free ride till the end
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	You don't seem to really be very passionate/care at all about the topics. I suspect that you had us do presentations so that you wouldn't have to instruct yourself. I understand if you aren't that crazy about this class, but if you don't care about what is being taught, you can't expect us to.
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Sometimes the lectures can be a little dry
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Teaching style is very boring. A power point on the exact text in the book and then written again on the whiteboard. In the end the tests weren't even about what you "learned" they were about whether you could figure out what one little word in each multiple choice the professor had changed to change the meaning of the answer. A lot of answers were 1 & 2 or 1 & 2 & 3 or 1 & 3 or 2 & 3.. very cumbersome and annoying testing style.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	More interaction with students regarding coursework
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Do more than just assign reading and questions from the book. Don't assign a programming project that's way out of the league of students at this level.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	assign more questions per homework
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Don't assign a coding project
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Very little communication with students from the professor. Professor would not respond to e-mail requesting support on homework and projects.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	A new text would be one place to start. I bought another book as a supplement to help. It was much better written and easier to understand. Giving PowerPoint presentations that have no interaction or explanation is just asinine. There needs to be better videos and more of them or the PowerPoints need to be accompanied with some sort of explanation. Reading and teaching myself on my own is NOT why I pay UNCC for my education.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The book and course need to correlate appropriately the project for this course is not relevant to the material covered in the course nor is it appropriate to be assigned due to the fact that material required for the project is from another edition of the book other than the one required for the course itself.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	E-mail response times are slow. There was a really hard program thrown in there after no help with how to do it or course material
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I emailed the teacher and didn't get a response until 3 weeks later. It was very disappointing because the email was about a major programming assignment that I needed a lot of help with. When the teacher finally emailed back, it was too late for help at that point.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	This class would be greatly improved by many things. Primarily this course should not be a purely online course, as the online format is not conducive to learning. Secondly the project from the course should not be a coding project of such scope as the one currently required. The project comes from the Third edition of the textbook, and uses source code from that edition of the book that is incomplete. This code and project have since been removed from the newer editions of the textbook. Finally this course's website needs to be updated from it's current form. The current course website has the appearance of being several years old, and there are multiple mentions of Blackboard.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Possibly links to the coursera course that covers the same material, very good lectures there
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Replying to emails in a timely manner being that it is an online course.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	There was absolutely no instruction provided for the course, and it was effectively a timed reading of the textbook from cover to cover. Text material was advanced, but testing was shallow and consisted mostly of "gotcha" questions. Project requirements were confusing, and the major goal of the project was not covered in great depth in the course. It felt like a project that was assigned for the sake of claiming a midterm project was assigned.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The final project was poorly explained and the TA and professor offered no assistance. This project needs to be reworked.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I would've liked more coding projects.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The only problem that I had with the course was the project given to the students. The given project appeared a bit related to the course but seemed very advanced from the material that was taught.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	None. Perfect.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	N/a
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Students were expected to pay attention to and ask questions to groups doing group presentations. However, the professor who was supposed to be grading the presentations would fail to do the same. Often she would have her boyfriend in class, sitting at the back of the class and playing on an iPad with him and giggling, not paying attention at all. I heard several things that the students presenting on that were wrong but the professor never caught it or called it out.
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Very nice professor, enjoyed the class
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Book gets an A+ for content, but a D- for brevity. Please make your assignments more intelligent. Your TA gave a straight pass/fail on the questions, so I put in no effort and got an A. Heck! I know for a fact that half of the answers I gave were flat-out wrong and I got 100%. Assign more intelligent projects; ones that are NOT in groups. It may be more difficult for you to grade, and I suspect that's why you didn't assign any, but I learned nothing from you. this semister. IT was all the book, because the lectures were too dry. I grant that this topic is drier than a week-old package of saltine crackers in the Sahara, but if you could try SOMETHING to make it more appealing, (like more clever code examples or something? Maybe program Raspberry Pis? Arduino?) it could be better.
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Professor appears to genuinely care for her students and is open to questions at any point of a lecture.
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Fire this instructor. She has no business teaching any course this way. Her methods are a disgrace to higher education in general and a slap in the face to the students who are forced to take this course. Implement arduino's and building an operating system in those. Or have students write their own Linux kernel. Something remotely innovative that challenges students and makes their time feel like it is valued. This course is a complete waste of time in its current form with this instructor. UNC Charlotte and the College of Computing and Informatics should be ashamed of this kind of shoddy work!
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	It would be nice if you wouldn't read directly from papers.
2014	Spring 2014	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Exams test ability to interpret questions but not the actual material.

2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Keep up the great work Computer Science Department of UNCC!!! This is a Fantastic course to take!!
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The TA was great providing answers and helping with the project.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	A few more projects might have been helpful. The tests did not accurately determine proficiency on the subject.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	I feel that I could have gotten the same benefit from this course by reading the text myself, and consulting a solutions manual for the exercises. I gained absolutely nothing from the instructor, so I'd hesitate to call it a "class."
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Programming project instructions were incredibly vague and required more significant programming knowledge than provided in prerequisite courses.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	This is fine for an introductory class.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	On the course website the teacher makes the claim of responding to emails "within 24 hours (except for weekends, or holidays)" however I have found that the response time is more like several weeks, if at all. There is also a mention that the teacher is available to meet with students if they need help, however in all of my attempted communications there was never any discussion of setting up a meeting, which may have resolved things much quicker.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	A steady schedule for course assignments. The days switched once and I missed an assignment because of it.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	This class is too important in my opinion to be taught on-line. This is my 4th on-line class through UNCC and they all have been disasters. The professors see the class as a distraction instead of a real class. I work full-time so I need the on-line option, but I want to learn the subject. If I just wanted to read a book and expect myself to learn it, that is what I would do and save myself the pain of paying for the class. I don't know this subject so I wanted to be educated in the subject. Did I learn some things? Sure, I read the book. I want someone to be able to explain the things I had a tough time with grasping. We had a project that was 20% or our grade that through interaction with fellow classmates I don't think one person truly understood. We had to code something that was never really taught except on a high level conceptual level. That is just not fair.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Very little information given regarding assignments and very lenient grading overall.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	N/A
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Assigning material from a previous edition of the book is totally unacceptable. Use information from the text you deem required for the course.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	It may be beneficial in the future if the teacher teaches.
2014	Spring 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Nice professor

2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	It is convenient because it is online.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Online course. Material was fine. Mainly reading from the book and answering questions every week.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	It's online, so I can't really say that I know anything about the instructor.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Homework was due consistently throughout the semester and was only moved around as a result of exams which greatly helped remember when assignments were due.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Great course, but I took it online, I didn't deal with the professor
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	terrible and aweful, would not take again
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Instructor is doing the best she can on a dull and technical topic, that most students already have a general understanding of, but need the specifics and technical details this class offers. It is hard to make that engaging.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	The instructor is friendly.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	She delegates her job to students really well.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Not many.

2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Group work is difficult online, especially when some group members expect everyone to meet in person. This should not be required for online courses.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The grading seems to determine on who ever the TA is for the semester. I had this professor before. I feel like grading should be a little more consistent.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Out of the whole semester, all the homework assignments we did were short answer questions, bar a single programming question. It was unexpected and I feel rather unnecessary, as this was not a programming course. Likewise, the group project that we did had parts that I felt were rather unnecessary, as this was not a programming course.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I would have liked something better than just reading the textbook for the course. She also had powerpoint slides, but the pretty much just had the pictures from the textbook. I felt that the group project should have been worth more. Homework and a project should not be worth the same amount. Feedback on homework was not helpful. No extra credit opportunities and no reminders about assignments.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Better slides from the professor.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	There is no instruction method. The teacher is actually the book and the work is also the book.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	It was satisfactory for my learning
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Course is very straight forward. Ready, practice problems, test. You know what's expected of you. Only problem is that there's no assignments after the 2nd test so there's no way to practice material.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The professor did not guide the student through the book, the material was too heavy for an online course. The professor was not active at all.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Class should be 75 minutes per week, one meeting, then online for the rest, so a hybrid course. Drop the group project, because we are giving a 1+ hour presentation with 30+ slides, and basically teaching part of the course (better than the professor I may add) without it being an Oral Intensive course. The structure of this course that the professor uses is not based on class meetings. Everything except the group presentation is online.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Less student teaching, more professor lecturing.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The course was laid out like an online class with an attendance policy. There was no reason to attend class other than to be marked present. All work and tests were done at home with the exception of one presentation.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Revamp the course syllabus entirely. This course was an absolute waste of time; we covered an extreme amount of information, in no amount of depth that we could retain it. The hour-long student presentations were painful to watch, and spending half of our total class time listening to a bunch of introverted CS students lecture on material they do not understand was anything but productive. Her voice is extremely monotone and it is impossible to concentrate for any length of time, God-forbid three hours.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	This course needs hands on engagement to allow one to understand the specifics of networking. All the book work could be done online, but it needs (for some assignments) hands on lab work to understand the protocols and networking procedures.
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I feel the presentations done through out the course are unnecessary and so is recording them.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Considering this is an online course, the professor should respond to emails much more quickly that 3 days.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	None
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The course is pretty boring. The most interesting part was the project, but other than that it's dull.
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	N/A
2015	Spring 2015	Operating Systems and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	passive professors like her and sara scott are the reason students hate the cci department. when professor change things in a class without justification, contrary to the original syllabus without the class having any input on it and tells students to deal with it when she has literally sent us 5 emails the entire semester and does the absolute bare minimum for the class (i.e posting up materials at the beginning of the semester and saying 'here you go') is not effective instruction, not to mention awkward submission times for assignments. Most of us took this class because the other sections time conflicts with ITCS 3688, and have part/fulltime work to pay our bills, yet she wants our assignments in by 6:30 rather than every other online class in existence allowing us to submit by midnight made it where some assignments were almost impossible to submit on time. fire her
2015	Spring 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	This is a course for two different CS focuses; why is the course so hard to get into? They fill up before you can get in. After you've made this course not terrible, please add more sections.

2016	Spring 2016	Knowledge Disc in Databases	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	1. Exercises at the end of the class shouldn't be given from text book. 2. May adopt different way of teaching, none of the concepts were clear. 3. The groups should be small. Most members of the group don't work or participate in any in-class assignments and projects. They easily get answers from 2 or 3 people who actually do the work. This is unfair to those who work as others get easy grades even by doing no work. 4. At the least, peer evaluation should be provided to analyse the contribution of team members.

2017	Spring 2017	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The class is very long and tedious with very little breaks and almost all of the time is used every class. The topics are also not especially fun so the class can feel a bit boring without a strong incentive to keep coming.

2017	Spring 2017	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I think since the topic is so vast, a more in depth study of topics would be beneficial to students, even if it makes the course more difficult.
2017	Spring 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Courses that are being adapted from graduate level courses should have material better suited for undergraduate level students. Some assignments, materials provided, and test questions are written at the graduate level There are too few test for the amount of material covered. Material needs to be broken down into smaller learning units and test created for those units. A student cannot recover from a bad test score with only two test for the entire semester.
2017	Spring 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Presentation style is too redundant. Instructor seems to drone on forever.
2017	Spring 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	This class was terrible. I found the content very interesting but the assignments were ridiculously difficult. Every single assignment we had was titles with 6190 which is the grad version of this class. The spark mlib program even said 8190 which is doctoral cloud. I get that she teaches the grad class but the undergrad needs to be made a lot easier. Not to make it an easy class but for the assignments to at least be understandable. We never has a single clue what we were doing. Also group members who didn't contribute shouldn't be penalized.
2017	Spring 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	There were many group assignments but only 2 or 3 people per group would actually work on them, and there were 7 people per group. The rest would do nothing but still get good grades that the ones working hard spent hours on. Not fair at all.
2017	Spring 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I believe the hands-on work was the most important part of this class for me. I learned a lot conceptually but when I tried to get into the apache Hadoop API and write my own programs I didn't fully understand. Also ran into the similar barriers when it came to Spark programs in scala. I was unfamiliar with syntax and practices but for a 3 credit hour course, that is a lot to ask for. I'd suggest a way to familiarize these new concepts for a more clear understanding of the field applications. Otherwise, it was a fantastic course and would recommend.
2017	Spring 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The topics in this courses are pretty complex and in my opinion there are too many different topics that are covered in this course

2017	Spring 2017	Knowledge Disc in Databases	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I don't think group projects make much sense for an online class. It would have been much better if the group activities were done on our own. From my personal experience, it was very difficult trying to meet with my other group members. One of them doesn't even live in Charlotte, and no one wanted to do video calls. I put a lot of effort into trying to communicate with everyone before the first project, and it didn't work out at all. When you don't see your group members, and you don't know any of them, it makes it very difficult to do assignments with them.

2017	Spring 2017	Cloud Comp for Data Analysis	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Our TA Arun was a complete asshole. He didn't know how to fix our errors and he told us we'd be fine if we submitted the code he couldn't fix. This wasn't the case as we got a 1 out of 2 a lot. I get it's not 6190 but give us a break.

2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	it was an online course that is severely out of date. The text is referencing Windows Vista as something to look forward to. The textbooks needs to be updated to be less obsolete.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	The class was very well paced.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	I really can't say much about the instructor; communication was fairly limited. I would have expected some sort of welcome email since this was an online class, but the only emails we got were reminders for tests and to check for our group members. I think the course overall was pretty weak, not in content necessarily, but in structure. The course was literally reading from a textbook and nothing else. Slides were provided online, but those were from the book's author and weren't very helpful.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	For an online course that only relies on a textbook for everything I think that it does a well job of making you read the book. If you don't read the book you fail.

2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	I received feedback very quickly. The instructor and teaching assistants were always available via email if I had any questions.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	It's online, so you don't have to go to the lecture for an entire semester on this material. Honestly I don't see how a full semester of lectures could be spiced up that much, so I find that taking this class and reading the material along with the exercises given is a great advantage.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	A hello email saying who we can contact if we have any issues O_o
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	No group project. It does not make sense to make a group project in an online class.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Upgrade to the next edition to include more relevant information.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I think that if this class had weekly online quizzes (based on the questions at the end) on each chapter instead of the questions we could learn more.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I would have like to see more effort put into the design of the course by the instructor. We had little interaction, which was fine to some extent, but there were only about 30 students in the class. It really seemed like no planning went into it; the Moodle course page was extremely basic, assignments were the "lectures" and those were reading straight from the book. It just didn't seem like the instructor really cared about the course, like it was thrown together in no more than five minutes.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	When returning a grade of less than 100, it should be required that the TA provide some comment as to why. The textbook is very bad. There's a new edition that may be better, but the figures provided are hard to grasp and the questions at the end of the chapter are often not able to be answered solely from the information in the book. The "lectures" provided were mostly just a slideshow of the figures from the book. This was not helpful. The "alternate slides" appear to be the result of past student work, and these sometimes contain errors. The project assignment was very light on details and was assigned 3 days later than the syllabus indicated it would be, while the due date was not adjusted.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Update the textbook. Reading and taking multiple choice test cannot be the best way to handle an online course. The group project was better since I interacted with my peers but still half of them had no idea what was going on.

2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Sometimes it takes a little longer than 24 hours for a response from an e-mail. An instructor(in my opinion) should try to be available whenever an exam is going on(give a set time when they will be available) in case any questions about wording or anything comes up. Sometimes the wording can be tricky and it isn't fair, but that's life I presume.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	To me, the project did not fit with the class. The only prerequisite for this course is ITCS 1213. The requirements for the project were WAY above that level. The instructions on the project were also vague.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	more lecture videos, in the past in similar courses we used simulation software, which helps aid in the learning process by doing.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Lectures are Powerpoints with an occasional video and all of the material is taken right out of the book. Lectures/Powerpoints need to be more original with more/better diagrams and/or animations/videos.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The professor should be available to answer questions, since this is an online class. The professor should answer emails promptly.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I would only subject that at the beginning of the course that the project be announced with the credential so that everyone can have more time to work together during the five week course.

2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The course was online. The instructor needs to be more available to answer emails. It would take 3-4 days to get a reply if I even got one at all.

2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	group projects are not easy online over the summer, could not meet with other students
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Please stop with the group projects. Group projects result in uneven participation and are not at all useful. Consider a smaller individual project, or multiple smaller individual projects.
2014	First Summer 2014	Operating Syst and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The project was very hard to do because of the time constraint. I suggest that instead of a project that students need to write an assignment explaining a particular topic that the instructor lets us do.

2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	group projects are hard in online only class can not meet classmates because summer and online
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Having an online class requires more than handing out a syllabus and a powerpoint. Take a look at how some of the EDX classes from MIT, Harvard and Stanford are done.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The vast majority of questions posed do not apply to this course. As this is an online course, there is no lecture session. As such, please treat all 'neutral' responses as 'do not apply to this course'.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Class was very informative and the group that I worked with on our project were fantastic. Once the project was announced we all pulled together and successfully completed the project on time and learned so much from each other. Great course.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Since this is an online class, it would be helpful if the professor posted some video lectures to reinforce all of the readings. This class felt like it was self-taught since all we did was read material from the book and answer questions. The project that was assigned did not appear to correspond to the material that we read in the book. It would be helpful if the programming concepts assigned in the project were actually taught in the class.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	I think the group project was great. Everyone in my group worked equally and for once I enjoyed it.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	This was an online course. So the only communication was through E-mail. I understand that with it being online course Powerpoints are a good and useful tool, but sense that is mostly all there is to the lecture the Powerpoints need to be really good.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Most were rated neutral, but because this class was on online class, we did not meet in the classroom, so I felt some of the questions were irrelevant
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	This was an online class so I was expecting video lectures from the professor. Instead I was just told to read out of the book and answer questions. I do not feel like that was effective. I'm sure I will not remember much of the material after this course is over since there was so much reading.
2014	First Summer 2014	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	It's a lot of reading, A LOT of reading.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Quick to respond to all questions. Very informative.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	The text for this course is great, I will be keeping it on my shelf. I enjoyed the deeper dive into topics I already had some familiarity with.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	This class was online so we didn't really get to know the professor, but she is still really great because she would always be there with an answer when we emailed her with questions.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	The class was online, so we did not correspond very much with the professor. Things were layed out in a clear way, and it made it very easy to to flow with the class.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Fantastic instructor, helped when asked and laid out he schedule very well.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Some of the YouTube videos were text to speech and were hard to understand without a few playbacks.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	There is a group project, which was not very effective. Trying to treat this class like any other class is not a good enough approach. The group project would be better if the scale would be lowered and made into an individual project. People take online classes because their schedules are not conducive to coming to campus, or because they have strange availabilities, and trying to work with a group does not take these students into account.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I don't think it really needs improvements.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I kind of wish I would have taken this course in person during a normal semester.

2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Enjoyed the course, no complaints. Exams are tough and provide necessary studying time.
2015	First Summer 2015	Intro to Computer Networks	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The class was just kind of there; lectures were not even lectures, just reading the textbook pretty much from to back every day. There were some additional videos, which was a good idea, but they didn't really prove to be too useful. Overall, it seemed like the class was just something the professor had planned out the first semester she taught it, and then it was automatically copied over in Moodle for each following semester.

2016	First Summer 2016	Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	The book makes the subject matter easy to understand. This class works well with knowledge gained from ITIS 2110 and ITIS 3110.
2016	First Summer 2016	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Please improve canvas functionality such as linking the student profiles to their school email and letting canvas email you when a response is made in a discussion forum and allow discussion forums to be subscribed to -by default- where the professor/TA sees fit.
2016	First Summer 2016	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Lectures were not used on the tests. I watched every lecture for the first part of the semester and took the first test to find that none of the questions were covered clearly in the lectures. It was all based on the book. Not given enough time to read the sections required either. Basically have to spend 7 hours a day reading in order to even keep up. Tests have trick questions where the wording is almost identical to the book but one word is changed. Tests are hard to study for because there is not enough time to read everything and lectures are useless. No study guides. The group project was worthless. On top of not being taught any coding, the subject matter was on a chapter we didn't cover until the day the project was due so we had to read ahead and stumble through programming Programming felt out of place in a class where no programming was taught.
2016	First Summer 2016	Operating Syst and Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	While conceptionally, an online group project will give students the necessary skills to work with a geodiverse team, it fails miserably. It penalizes the good students by increasing his/her workload and helps the bad students because they get a free ride off of the good students. There really isn't a mechanism to prevent this. Personally, I found that I had a great deal more work to finish because of this and was not as focused as I should be on learning the other material. I also found the material to be lacking and the tests were not designed to test your knowledge but to trick you.

2016	First Summer 2016	Operating Syst and Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	The best resource for this class was the book and the youtube videos. Have more videos on topics covered by the test and reduce the amount of reading required to do well and this might have been a decent class. I had one online class before and it was by far one of the best classes I have had. Book examples and video cases were the only way I learned in this class and even those were not suitable for the level of difficulty of the test.
2017	First Summer 2017	Introduction to Data Mining	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Lectures are recorded and available online along with example problems and learning resources. It's always easy to learn material on your own time if needed in one of Professor Tzacheva's classes. She is very professional, and her classes are the most conducive to learning at UNCC in my experience.

2017	First Summer 2017	Introduction to Data Mining	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	I did not think it was fair that this was an undergraduate class that was presented with a graduate level of main project(the title wasn't even changed on the assignemt and still read 6132) plus it was more difficult then the original graduate project since that one did not include a UI or to make video. The RSES project was incredibly confusing due to there being no program instructions and the informtion could not be found in a google search. The book used was made in 2005 and still cost close to $100 to rent in the book store. I understand using an older book to save money but this does not seem to be the case. Also the book is 12 years old and being such a rapidity devopling field a book does not cover more recent topics that would be relavent in today's world. The basic algorithms may be the same but I wish I learned more about what is currently being used and some real world examples.
2017	First Summer 2017	Introduction to Data Mining	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Group projects/work are especially difficult in a 1 month long online class.
2017	First Summer 2017	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	-Should learn more about Canvas setup for online learning to make it more friendly (ex.

2017	First Summer 2017	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	My only criticism is regarding the group project. This class was labelled as a distance educaiton class yet we had a group project where we needed to meet up together. I personally was half way across the country and unable to participate in the level to which i had wanted to. While there are other methods of communication, it being an online course made it extremely difficult to get this project finished.
2017	First Summer 2017	Introduction to Data Mining	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Please create a true undergraduate level class where the projects and tests are not graduate level. Please use a text book that was written in this decade. Please modernize this corse. This would be an awesome graduate level class in 2006.

2017	Second Summer 2017	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The lecture videos from on campus sessions are not good, at least use a tripod. Reading whole chapters that have 100+ pages of technical information does not help retain the main concepts. The course needs to be restructured.
2017	Second Summer 2017	Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Instead of being stylized for Summer, the course appears to just be a copy of the Fall/Spring course with date changes.

2018	First Summer 2018	 Intro to Computer Networks	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Instructor uses the book and instructional videos to teach the class. Videos are often inadequate or inaccurate.
2018	First Summer 2018	 Intro to Machine Learning	Please list outstanding strengths of the course and/or instructor	Well, she clearly has the online course setup so as to permit her to exert the least effort possible. You could take her materials, upload them to Canvas, and cut her out of the process entirely for the same effect.
2018	First Summer 2018	 Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Create a curriculum that does not involve these videos and something that is more clear.
2018	First Summer 2018	 Intro to Computer Networks	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	It was great for an online course.
2018	First Summer 2018	 Intro to Machine Learning	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	What is... everywhere? I think this instructor has no understanding of what an online summer course should look like. 1. Organization: Summer courses are compact and focused meaning that BOTH the students AND the instructor should demonstrate good organizational skills so that precious time is not wasted trying to locate materials. The instructor has organized her Canvas page as one long list of materials and resources, organized by the date they are meant to be viewed. This means, since they're not sorted by the information they're related to, it is nearly impossible to find a specific file to refer back to. Since you don't know which of the literally dozens of videos and links are relevant to what you're trying to find, you're always better off finding a different resource online. Every single instruction for every single assignment was a text file. That means there were no visual examples, no way to follow along with setting up the various programs and environments needed to complete course materials. A text file that she couldn't even bother to host on Canvas, so she redirects you to a UNCC page to view it. This means that you can't view the instructions in an embedded Canvas window, and have to go on a scavenger hunt of links to find an assignment's instructions. Additionally, assignments often contained instructions that contradicted themselves. Every group assignment on Canvas contained the phrase "one group member submits this Exercise for the whole group", as well as a link to the .txt document instructions. However, the txt document instructions, only visible if you click, would say "Each student should upload this part of the project individually." This is needlessly confusing, and only occurred because the instructor was too lazy to create a unique assignment page for each project, instead reusing the same one for the mere four assignments. This sort of pointless and confusing corner cutting is a perfect example of the instructor's approach to teaching. Another great example of just plan misinformation was the required texts for the course. In the syllabus, the required texts are listed as follows: Textbook: 1. " Introduction to Machine Learning " , Second Edition, Ethem ALPAYDIN, The MIT Press, 2010: ISBN-10: 0-262-01243-X, ISBN-13: 978-0-262-01243-0 2. "Introduction to Data Mining" by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbauch, and Vipin Kumar. Addison Wesley, 2005. ISBN: 0321321367 However, in group assignment 04, the instructor alerts us that there is indeed another required text to do that assignment. In those text instructions, she includes: 2. Read from textbook : "Hadoop the Definitive Guide" http://www.amazon.com/Hadoop-Definitive-Guide-Tom-White/dp/1491901632 - Chapter 1 Meet Hadoop , - Chapter 2 MapReduce , - Chapter 3 The Hadoop Distributed File System , - Chapter 6 Developing a MapReduce Application , - Chapter 7 How MapReduce Works , - Chapter 8 MapReduce Types and Formats , - Chapter 9 MapReduce Features So not only provided a new never before seen textbook in instructions that wouldn't see until you opened them, (and I guarantee you no one goes through at the start of the class looking for phantom textbooks the instructor may have forgotten to mention), she also assigns seven chapters of reading in the same stroke. I understand that summer courses are intended to be focused, but the point of an instructor is, surprisingly, to instruct. Not to assign with a broad brush an unrealistic amount of work that you would only have foreknowledge of if you bothered to download and read the instructions for every assignment from the beginning of the class. 2. Course material: Everything you touched in this course that related to the course material was always so ancient that I have a hard time believing it's relevant. It's not like machine learning is a modern, highly competitive field that has changed with the landscape of technology. One textbook was published in 2005, the other, the newest piece of information in the course, was published in 2010. The software we used to perform assignments, RSES (Updates ended in 2005), PuTTY (Initial release in 1999), WinSCP (released in 2000). These programs are old, clunky, and not at all intuitive to use. Because the instructors directions are merely plain text, for every program it required Herculean effort just to get to the point where you could start the assignment. After you did manage to get the programs working, the actual assignments were so trivial so as to be useless to learning. Frequently only amounting to copying a program, running it, and submitting a screenshot of the output. This sort of pointless "homework" does nothing to reinforce course materials and only serves as a waste of time. This instructor is lazy, plain and simple. She is too lazy to put any effort into her Canvas page to make it more navigable. She is too lazy to update her course materials and assignments with anything from the last decade. She is too lazy to make assignment instructions clear and understandable. And she is too lazy to use anything but a copy and paste template that I would be willing to be she's be using since she got tenure at the University. Why this woman is teaching 4000 level CS classes is beyond me. Why she is not forced to update her material or attempt to improve upon her teaching is an absolute enigma to me. Why she continues to maintain at this university, despite a clear disregard for the quality of learning she provides to her students, fills me with an almost indescribable amount of frustration. This instructor wasted my time, she wasted my money, and she taught me nothing, I repeat NOTHING, about the subject. Every single bit of information I have from this past month has been garnered from internet resources I've found myself, and there was no point in me being enrolled in this course. P.S. I've come back to edit this in order to head off a possible dismissal of these claims. If the solution to these complaints is to reach out to the professor and ask for clarification on unclear assignments or communication, I assure you that this was attempted. Take this post on the Canvas discussion page regarding a group assignment: Can you post a clearer instruction for this ? I don't know what to do with these 2 programs to get the results. This post received no response from the instructor. The assignment instructions were not updated, and not action was taken in any way to clarify the ambiguity.

2018	Second Summer 2018	 Intro Oper Syst & Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	She can be hard to understand due to the extremely low volume on her videos. The videos are also often split up lecture recordings, with gaps in between videos so we miss information.
2018	Second Summer 2018	 Intro Oper Syst & Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	Since the project requires coding in java, it would be helpful if the class does have a java prerequisite or does cover a java tutorial.

2018	Second Summer 2018	 Intro Oper Syst & Networking	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	The instructor could bother to find good videos or record her own lectures. The textbook is fine, but the video content is sub-par and disappointing. The group project is not relevant to the class and doesn't make any sense.

2018	Spring 2018	 Knowledge Disc in Databases	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	There should be no midterm and final. Instead of that we should do more coding assignments.
2018	Spring 2018	 Knowledge Disc in Databases	Please suggest areas for improvement of the course and/or instruction method	According to the materials, and the way instructor teaches and based on my experience in this class, with all respects, I believe: 1- This is not a graduate level course, in the best case it is high school course. Materials are extremely basic. Counting the number of appearances, computing UNION, running some simple codes in applications to see the result is not what grad student supposed to learn for the research. KDD is a big brand and I supposed to learn much more about data mining, pattern recognition, and knowledge discovery techniques. 2- Instructor should organize the course materials. This is not acceptable to see too many descriptions, instructions, and resource for course materials such as assignments and project. To be clear, there is an external link in canvas which transfers you to the course material webpage which contains slides, videos and assignment/project definitions. While each one of mentioned files are also uploaded to the canvas as well, but in many cases with differences. Everybody agreed that understanding the assignments takes much much more time than doing the assignment. Furthermore, there are too many sub-link in each link which directs you to another page. In this case, if you see/find something in one webpage, it is very difficult to find it again after you close it due to too many links. I believe any instructor is responsible to organize the course materials for ease of use. I encounter with this problem a lot of time especially when I was doing the project different phases that instructor asked something, while in assignment definition they wanted something else. THIS IS a real HEADACHE! 3- Instructor is ALWAYS late. class starts at 6:30 and everybody are in the class. Very very rarely I saw the instructor comes on time (maybe 1 or 2 times). She usually shows up at least 20-25 minutes up to 45 minutes late. I believe grad students, register each individual course for a specific goal and their time and effort must be respected/appreciated. This is not respectful/professional to wait half an hour MANY TIMES to see the instructor. If there was not roll attendance, very few session could be held because everybody could leave after 15-20mins. Moreover, there is a break in the middle of class, usually, we have being asked to be in the class in 10 mins but instructor comes back and starts the class after maybe 20 minutes. Come on! it is 8:45 PM! 4- Instructor should be responsible for responding students emails. Students cannot talk to TA about some problems! TA is only responsible for assignments, not anything else. 5- Smile is good, even in the class! Personally, if I do not see a sign of kindness (like a smile) in somebody, I would never go and ask a question or share something with that guy. A student should feel comfortable when he/she talks to a person. This feeling gets worse when few times you try to ask something like "where can I find ..." or "How can I ..." and get this aggressive response: "It is written!". If I knew where it is written (according to toooooo many links/web pages), why I would ask? 6- This is not good to have the elementary school atmosphere in the graduate level course where you always being told that "if you do not do something, you will lose points". Heard it thousand times. We are here to learn something, the grade is not important that much! 7- The worst part is doing assignment and exams using MS Word. It is a real torture to draw trees and labeling them, write equations with subscripts, superscripts, and prepare some kind of flowchart using Word. For a single assignment or even the exam, we could do it quickly using pen and paper while we must do it using Word that takes time at least 3-4 times more. What is the point? As an adult, we can do it clean and clear by pen and paper, if we don't, we deserve point deduction. This is not cool to waste time on unnecessary things. 8- Some videos are provided. Many of them are just ridiculous. Poor video/voice quality, the recorder moves the camera a lot which causes a headache. You are not able to hear the instructor and/or see the board. I have taken lots of online courses in which, the instructor sits and records the video alone in a quiet room. The video shows the slides and instructor -who is well prepared for recording- talks behind clearly and you can find out everything you want easily. At the end, with all respect to everybody, this class was all about wasting too much time to get easy "A". No learning point! I just regret to take this class and I would never recommend it to anybody.

The latest she had ever arrived was approximately 45 minutes after the start of class. We were expected to code with Hadoop and MapReduce in Cloudera without any instruction from her. She would often times reference PowerPoint presentations from many months prior and lecture on these PowerPoints again before lecturing on the material for the current day. Her instructions were unclear and she would change her requirements at the last minute. She would never alert us about these changes without prompting from the class. The topics were discussed in a vague and incomprehensible manner. Due to her late arrival to the course, we would not have enough time left to work on in-class assignments which were due the same night at 11:55pm.

2019	First Summer 2019	 Intro Oper Syst & Networking	Please provide other observations, comments, or suggestions	Test questions should test students on how well they understand a topic, not how well they can precisely memorize sections of the textbook. I did not enjoy the trick questions that were present on every test. For example, changing one word in an otherwise true statement to make it false is not an example of qualty test writing.
