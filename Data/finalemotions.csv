I am very upset at how this professor has performed. This professor is the laziest professor I have ever come across. Lectures are just reading off of notes and writing a bunch of words on the board, which usually have no relevance to any assignments or the tests. Assignments consist of 2 questions semi-randomly plucked from the textbook. Video assignments are just YouTube videos (that are not hers) with questions taken straight from the video. Time management for her lectures is awful, as she initially has assignments due at the end of class but either a) leaves about 10 minutes to turn them in or b) extends the deadline to midnight because she left no time at all. Group work and presentations are a complete waste of time. Tests are absolutely horrible and lazily thrown together (One question's correct answer was based on the difference between ""exits"" and ""exists""). I would like to mention that I think the flipped class style of the course is NOT to blame. I am taking an Accounting class which is a flipped class and it is actually quite good. But in that case the professor actually puts EFFORT into the course (Example: He makes all of the videos we watch outside of class himself rather than plucking videos from YouTube).

She doesn't seem excited about this course, the students learning about the subject material, or anything really. It is very sad. The book is terrible. Get rid of it. It is a waste of money and effort to read. Most of the information in the book is dated. The questions in the book rarely connect with the actual chapter material anyway. The book is the basis for tests. For a student to do well in this course, you don't need to understand the actual material. To do well in this course all you really need to be able to do is read the book. This is useless. Each question on the test is set up to trick you without testing your knowledge, only your reading comprehension skills. The tests don't test you, they test you against the book. The homework questions for the material are a waste of time and aren't really reflected in the tests. This wastes everyone's time. The lecture is boring and has no value as she essentially ""vomits"" information on the board ""guided"" by a powerpoint.

If I just wanted to read a book and expect myself to learn it, that is what I would do and save myself the pain of paying for the class. I don't know this subject so I wanted to be educated in the subject. Did I learn some things? Sure, I read the book. I want someone to be able to explain the things I had a tough time with grasping. We had a project that was 20% or our grade that through interaction with fellow classmates I don't think one person truly understood. We had to code something that was never really taught except on a high level conceptual level. That is just not fair.

While there are other methods of communication, it being an online course made it extremely difficult to get this project finished.

understanding what online summer course look like organization summer courses compact focused meaning students the instructor should demonstrate good organizational skills that precious time is wasted trying locate materials the instructor has organized canvas page one long list of materials and resources organized the date are meant to viewed this means since they're not sorted by the information they're related to is nearly impossible to find specific file to refer back to since know of the literally dozens of videos and links are relevant to what trying to find you're always better finding different resource online every single instruction every single assignment text file that means no visual examples no way to follow along setting the various programs and environments needed to complete course materials text file that even bother to host canvas so she redirects you to page to view it this means that you can't view the instructions an embedded canvas window and to go on scavenger hunt of links to find an assignment's instructions additionally assignments often contained instructions that contradicted every group assignment on canvas contained the phrase one group member submits this exercise for the whole group as well as link to the document instructions however the document instructions visible you click would say student should upload this part of the project individually this is needlessly confusing and only occurred the instructor was lazy to create unique assignment page for each project instead reusing the one for the mere four assignments this sort of pointless and confusing corner cutting is perfect example of the instructor's approach to teaching another great example of plan misinformation was the required texts for the course in the syllabus the required texts are listed as follows textbook introduction to machine learning second edition ethem the press introduction to data mining by pang ning tan michael steinbauch and vipin kumar addison wesley however in group assignment the instructor alerts us that there is indeed another required text to that assignment in text instructions she includes read textbook hadoop the definitive guide chapter meet hadoop chapter map reduce chapter the hadoop distributed file system chapter developing map reduce application chapter map reduce works chapter map reduce types and formats chapter map reduce features so not only provided new never seen textbook in instructions that see you opened and guarantee you no one goes the start of the class looking for phantom textbooks the instructor may have forgotten to mention she also assigns seven chapters of reading in the same stroke understand that summer courses are intended to be focused the point of an instructor is surprisingly to instruct not to assign with broad brush an unrealistic amount of work that you would only have foreknowledge of if you bothered to download and read the instructions for every assignment from the beginning of the class course material everything you touched in this course that related to the course material was always so ancient that have hard time believing relevant it's not like machine learning is modern highly competitive field that has changed with the landscape of technology one textbook was published in the the newest piece of information in the course was published in the software used to perform assignments updates ended in pu initial release in win released in programs are old clunky and not at intuitive to use because the instructors directions are merely plain text for every program it required herculean effort just to get to the point you could start the assignment you manage to get the programs working the actual assignments were so trivial so as to be useless to learning frequently only amounting to copying program running it and submitting screenshot of the output this sort of pointless homework nothing to reinforce course materials and only serves as waste of time this instructor is lazy plain and simple she is too lazy to put effort her canvas page to make it navigable she is too lazy to update her course materials and assignments with anything from the last decade she is too lazy to make assignment instructions clear and understandable and she is too lazy to use anything but copy and paste template that would be willing to be be using since she got tenure at the university this woman is teaching level classes is beyond why she is not forced to update her material attempt to improve upon her teaching is an absolute enigma to me why she continues to maintain at this university despite clear disregard for the quality of learning she provides to her students fills me with an almost indescribable amount of frustration this instructor wasted time she wasted my money and she taught me nothing repeat the subject every single bit of information have from this past month has garnered from internet resources i've found and there was no point in me enrolled in this course i've come back to edit this in order to head off possible dismissal of these claims if the solution to these complaints is to reach to the professor and ask for clarification on unclear assignments or communication assure you that this was attempted take this post on the canvas discussion page regarding group assignment you post clearer instruction for this don't know what to do with these programs to get the results this post received no response from the instructor the assignment instructions were not updated and not action was taken in any way to clarify the ambiguity text text,"What is... everywhere? I think this instructor has no understanding of what an online summer course should look like. 1. Organization: Summer courses are compact and focused meaning that BOTH the students AND the instructor should demonstrate good organizational skills so that precious time is not wasted trying to locate materials. The instructor has organized her Canvas page as one long list of materials and resources, organized by the date they are meant to be viewed. This means, since they're not sorted by the information they're related to, it is nearly impossible to find a specific file to refer back to. Since you don't know which of the literally dozens of videos and links are relevant to what you're trying to find, you're always better off finding a different resource online. Every single instruction for every single assignment was a text file. That means there were no visual examples, no way to follow along with setting up the various programs and environments needed to complete course materials. A text file that she couldn't even bother to host on Canvas, so she redirects you to a UNCC page to view it. This means that you can't view the instructions in an embedded Canvas window, and have to go on a scavenger hunt of links to find an assignment's instructions. Additionally, assignments often contained instructions that contradicted themselves. Every group assignment on Canvas contained the phrase ""one group member submits this Exercise for the whole group"", as well as a link to the .txt document instructions. However, the txt document instructions, only visible if you click, would say ""Each student should upload this part of the project individually."" This is needlessly confusing, and only occurred because the instructor was too lazy to create a unique assignment page for each project, instead reusing the same one for the mere four assignments. This sort of pointless and confusing corner cutting is a perfect example of the instructor's approach to teaching. Another great example of just plan misinformation was the required texts for the course. In the syllabus, the required texts are listed as follows: Textbook: 1. "" Introduction to Machine Learning "" , Second Edition, Ethem ALPAYDIN, The MIT Press, 2010: ISBN-10: 0-262-01243-X, ISBN-13: 978-0-262-01243-0 2. ""Introduction to Data Mining"" by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbauch, and Vipin Kumar. Addison Wesley, 2005. ISBN: 0321321367 However, in group assignment 04, the instructor alerts us that there is indeed another required text to do that assignment. In those text instructions, she includes: 2. Read from textbook : ""Hadoop the Definitive Guide"" http://www.amazon.com/Hadoop-Definitive-Guide-Tom-White/dp/1491901632 - Chapter 1 Meet Hadoop , - Chapter 2 MapReduce , - Chapter 3 The Hadoop Distributed File System , - Chapter 6 Developing a MapReduce Application , - Chapter 7 How MapReduce Works , - Chapter 8 MapReduce Types and Formats , - Chapter 9 MapReduce Features So not only provided a new never before seen textbook in instructions that wouldn't see until you opened them, (and I guarantee you no one goes through at the start of the class looking for phantom textbooks the instructor may have forgotten to mention), she also assigns seven chapters of reading in the same stroke. I understand that summer courses are intended to be focused, but the point of an instructor is, surprisingly, to instruct. Not to assign with a broad brush an unrealistic amount of work that you would only have foreknowledge of if you bothered to download and read the instructions for every assignment from the beginning of the class. 2. Course material: Everything you touched in this course that related to the course material was always so ancient that I have a hard time believing it's relevant. It's not like machine learning is a modern, highly competitive field that has changed with the landscape of technology. One textbook was published in 2005, the other, the newest piece of information in the course, was published in 2010. The software we used to perform assignments, RSES (Updates ended in 2005), PuTTY (Initial release in 1999), WinSCP (released in 2000). These programs are old, clunky, and not at all intuitive to use. Because the instructors directions are merely plain text, for every program it required Herculean effort just to get to the point where you could start the assignment. After you did manage to get the programs working, the actual assignments were so trivial so as to be useless to learning. Frequently only amounting to copying a program, running it, and submitting a screenshot of the output. This sort of pointless ""homework"" does nothing to reinforce course materials and only serves as a waste of time. This instructor is lazy, plain and simple. She is too lazy to put any effort into her Canvas page to make it more navigable. She is too lazy to update her course materials and assignments with anything from the last decade. She is too lazy to make assignment instructions clear and understandable. And she is too lazy to use anything but a copy and paste template that I would be willing to be she's be using since she got tenure at the University. Why this woman is teaching 4000 level CS classes is beyond me. Why she is not forced to update her material or attempt to improve upon her teaching is an absolute enigma to me. Why she continues to maintain at this university, despite a clear disregard for the quality of learning she provides to her students, fills me with an almost indescribable amount of frustration. This instructor wasted my time, she wasted my money, and she taught me nothing, I repeat NOTHING, about the subject. Every single bit of information I have from this past month has been garnered from internet resources I've found myself, and there was no point in me being enrolled in this course. P.S. I've come back to edit this in order to head off a possible dismissal of these claims. If the solution to these complaints is to reach out to the professor and ask for clarification on unclear assignments or communication, I assure you that this was attempted. Take this post on the Canvas discussion page regarding a group assignment: Can you post a clearer instruction for this ? I don't know what to do with these 2 programs to get the results. This post received no response from the instructor. The assignment instructions were not updated, and not action was taken in any way to clarify the ambiguity.

Materials are extremely basic. Counting the number of appearances, computing UNION, running some simple codes in applications to see the result is not what grad student supposed to learn for the research. KDD is a big brand and I supposed to learn much more about data mining, pattern recognition, and knowledge discovery techniques. 2- Instructor should organize the course materials. This is not acceptable to see too many descriptions, instructions, and resource for course materials such as assignments and project. To be clear, there is an external link in canvas which transfers you to the course material webpage which contains slides, videos and assignment/project definitions. While each one of mentioned files are also uploaded to the canvas as well, but in many cases with differences. Everybody agreed that understanding the assignments takes much much more time than doing the assignment. Furthermore, there are too many sub-link in each link which directs you to another page. In this case, if you see/find something in one webpage, it is very difficult to find it again after you close it due to too many links. I believe any instructor is responsible to organize the course materials for ease of use. I encounter with this problem a lot of time especially when I was doing the project different phases that instructor asked something, while in assignment definition they wanted something else. THIS IS a real HEADACHE! 3- Instructor is ALWAYS late. class starts at 6:30 and everybody are in the class. Very very rarely I saw the instructor comes on time (maybe 1 or 2 times). She usually shows up at least 20-25 minutes up to 45 minutes late. I believe grad students, register each individual course for a specific goal and their time and effort must be respected/appreciated. This is not respectful/professional to wait half an hour MANY TIMES to see the instructor. If there was not roll attendance, very few session could be held because everybody could leave after 15-20mins. Moreover, there is a break in the middle of class, usually, we have being asked to be in the class in 10 mins but instructor comes back and starts the class after maybe 20 minutes. Come on! it is 8:45 PM! 4- Instructor should be responsible for responding students emails. Students cannot talk to TA about some problems! TA is only responsible for assignments, not anything else. 5- Smile is good, even in the class! Personally, if I do not see a sign of kindness (like a smile) in somebody, I would never go and ask a question or share something with that guy. A student should feel comfortable when he/she talks to a person. This feeling gets worse when few times you try to ask something like ""where can I find ..."" or ""How can I ..."" and get this aggressive response: ""It is written!"". If I knew where it is written (according to toooooo many links/web pages), why I would ask? 6- This is not good to have the elementary school atmosphere in the graduate level course where you always being told that ""if you do not do something, you will lose points"". Heard it thousand times. We are here to learn something, the grade is not important that much! 7- The worst part is doing assignment and exams using MS Word. It is a real torture to draw trees and labeling them, write equations with subscripts, superscripts, and prepare some kind of flowchart using Word. For a single assignment or even the exam, we could do it quickly using pen and paper while we must do it using Word that takes time at least 3-4 times more. What is the point? As an adult, we can do it clean and clear by pen and paper, if we don't, we deserve point deduction. This is not cool to waste time on unnecessary things. 8- Some videos are provided. Many of them are just ridiculous. Poor video/voice quality, the recorder moves the camera a lot which causes a headache. You are not able to hear the instructor and/or see the board. I have taken lots of online courses in which, the instructor sits and records the video alone in a quiet room. The video shows the slides and instructor -who is well prepared for recording- talks behind clearly and you can find out everything you want easily. At the end, with all respect to everybody, this class was all about wasting too much time to get easy ""A"". No learning point! I just regret to take this class and I would never recommend it to anybody.
